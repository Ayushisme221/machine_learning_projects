# Wholesale Price Index (WPI) Prediction 📊

This project predicts the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) using multiple linear regression. The dataset was sourced from the Indian Government portal and spans from 2012 to 2023.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Indian Government WPI dataset (2012–2023)
- Features used: 
  - Commodity Code
  - Commodity Weight
  - Month
  - Year

## 🔍 What I Did
- Melted and cleaned the dataset
- Created feature set (`X`) and target (`y`)
- Used **Multiple Linear Regression** (OLS from `statsmodels`)
- Implemented **Backward Elimination** for feature selection
- Evaluated model accuracy on test data

## 📉 Observations
- Model has some limitations and room for improvement
- Accuracy isn't perfect but offers a solid learning foundation
- Will explore more advanced models like **Random Forest** or **XGBoost** in future versions

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Working with real-world data
- Feature engineering and selection
- Regression model evaluation
- Model limitations and the need for iteration

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add polynomial or non-linear models
- Experiment with other regression techniques
- Improve accuracy using better preprocessing

**Note**: This project is part of my ongoing machine learning journey. More improvements and models coming soon!
